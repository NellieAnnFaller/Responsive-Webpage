       <h2>Plot</h2>
       <p class="text1">The Teiko Middle School basketball team dominated basketball teams within Japan, 
       winning the middle school Nationals for three consecutive years. 
       The star players of the team became known as the "Generation of Miracles". 
       After graduating from middle school, the five star players went to different high schools with 
       top basketball teams. However, there was a rumor that there was another player in the "Generation of Miracles": 
       a phantom sixth man. This mysterious player is now a freshman at Seirin High, a new school with a powerful, 
       if little-known, team. Now, Tetsuya Kuroko – the sixth member of the "Generation of Miracles", 
       and Taiga Kagami – a naturally talented player who spent most of his youth in the US, 
       aim to bring Seirin to the top of Japan by taking on Kuroko's former teammates one by one. 
       The series chronicles Seirin's rise to become Japan's number one high school team. 
       The Generation of Miracles include Ryota Kise, Shintaro Midorima, Daiki Aomine, Atsushi Murasakibara, 
       and Seijuro Akashi.

       Seirin High team faced Ryota Kise's team first in a practice match. 
       Although Kise was capable of copying all of Kagami's skills with added strength and speed, 
       Kuroko's abilities helped narrow the distance and eventually, Seirin won this game. 
       They then met Shintaro Midorima's school Shutoku in the preliminaries of Interhigh. 
       The game was much more difficult; not only was Midorima considerably stronger than Kagami, 
       but also Kuroko's ability of misdirection was completely shut down by Takao's Hawk Eyes. 
       Seirin managed to defeat team Shutoku but their winning streak ended after they lost badly to Touhou Academy, 
       whose basketball team included the Ace of the "Generation of Miracles" - Daiki Aomine. 
       After this game, they lost their remaining two matches against Senshinkan and Meisei and 
       were eliminated from the Interhigh. However, a new player arrives to join Seirin - Kiyoshi Teppei, 
       the man who formed the Seirin Basketball team. They spent the entire summer training for the Winter Cup, 
       even coincidentally meeting Shutoku while training.
       
       In the preliminaries, they met team Shutoku again. This match ended into a tie, 
       so Seirin needed to defeat team Kirisaki Daichi in order to advance. Kirisaki Daichi's 
       captain was Makoto Hanamiya, a member of the Uncrowned Kings well-known for his underhanded 
       methods to win a match. However, they won and gained a ticket to the Winter Cup. </p>
